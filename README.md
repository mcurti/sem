# Spectral Element Method implementation in MATLAB

This application is a PDE solver for electromechanical applications using Spectral Element Method (SEM).

## Getting Started

Find a demo project in DEMOS folder and run it

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
To have this application (looks more like a set of scripts) running, an instalation of MATLAB is necessary. No other additional toolboxes are needed.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
The instalation is simple, copy the folders somewhere on your computer. Then add the directories into MATLAB via set path option, if not familiar with this, it is very easy to find on google.
```

## Running the tests

In the folder DEMOS, there is a demo file which can be used to run the app, and, hopefully gives an understanding on how the application works.
