# Spectral Element Method implementation in MATLAB

This application is a PDE solver for electromechanical applications using Spectral Element Method (SEM).

## Getting Started

Find a demo project in DEMOS folder and run it

### Prerequisites

```
To have SEM running, an instalation of MATLAB is necessary. The application is meant to run without additional packages. However, if there you encounter some additional requests for other toolboxes, let me know.
```

### Installing


```
The instalation is simple, copy the folders somewhere on your computer. Then add the directories into MATLAB via set path option.
```

## Running the tests

In the folder DEMOS, there is a demo file which can be used to run the app, and, hopefully gives an understanding on how the application works.
